# Real-Time Analytics Pipeline (Phase 1)

This project is part of a multi-phase journey to build a real-time analytics pipeline using Kafka, Flink, Redis, and FastAPI.

## ✅ Phase 1: Event Ingestion with Kafka
- FastAPI `/track` endpoint receives events
- Kafka producer sends events
- Kafka consumer logs events
- Docker Compose for Kafka & Zookeeper setup

📍 Next: Stream processing with Flink in Phase 2!
